# Classification-on-Fashion-MNIST-with-TensorFlow-TensorFlow-Quantum-and-Cirq

* The Repository contains implementation of Quantum Neural Network as well as Classical Convolutional Neural Network for Classification Task on the popular Fashion MNIST dataset.
* For the Quantum Implementation, TensorFlow-Quantum and Cirq are used.
* For the Classical Implementation, TensorFLow 2.x and TensorBoard are used.
* The Jupyter Notebooks are developed in Google Colab.
* The TensorBoard Visualization used in Classical Implementation may or may not work in other environments like Kaggle. Therefore, it is recommended to run it in Google Colab.
* The Repository contains weights for trained Classical and Quantum Models.
